            Klondike is configured to process NuGet symbol packages
            and serve symbols and source code to your debugger.
        </p>

        <p>
            Point Visual Studio to this symbol server:
        </p>

        {{code-snippet content=model.symbolServer}}

        <p>
            See <a href="http://www.symbolsource.org/Public/Wiki/Using">this guide</a> from
            <a href="http://www.symbolsource.org/">SymbolSource</a> for more details on how
            to configure Visual Studio.
        </p>

        <p>
            {{#if model.symbolsAvailable}}
                Some packages already have symbols. Debug away!
            {{else}}
                No symbol packages have been pushed to Klondike.
                You'll need to do this before attempting to use Klondike
                as a symbol server.
            {{/if}}
        </p>
    {{else}}
        <p>
            Klondike can be configured to process NuGet symbol packages,
            but you need to install Debugging Tools for Windows and tell
            Klondike where to find them by editing <code>debuggingToolsPath</code>
            in <code>Settings.config</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The path should contain the <code>symstore.exe</code> utility.
        </p>
    {{/if}}
